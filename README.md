Customer Segmentation is a process of dividing the customer base into various segments or various groups based on a few common features. Here, K Means clustering is used to segment the users data into various segments.

<h3>Project Overview:</h3>
The goal of this project is to develop a customer segmentation system for a shopping mall that can group customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior, demographic information, and other relevant attributes. This will enable more targeted and effective marketing strategies tailored to the specific needs and preferences of each customer segment.

<h3>Approach:</h3>
I have leveraged the K-Means clustering algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning technique, to partition the customer dataset into K distinct clusters. The algorithm works by iteratively assigning data points (customers) to cluster centroids and updating the centroids based on the mean of the points in each cluster.

<h3>Data Preparation:</h3>
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle with the data containing details regarding the purchasing history of each customer. The project will begin with data cleaning and preprocessing of the customer dataset, which may include handling missing values, removing outliers, and scaling/normalizing numerical features. Relevant features such as purchase history, customer demographics, and engagement metrics will be selected and transformed into a suitable format for the clustering algorithm.

<h3>K-Means Implementation:</h3>
The K-Means algorithm will be implemented using a Python library like scikit-learn. The optimal number of clusters (K) will be determined through techniques like the elbow method. The algorithm will be trained on the preprocessed customer data, and each customer will be assigned to one of the K clusters based on their feature similarities.

<h3>Cluster Analysis and Interpretation:</h3>
Once the clusters are formed, we will analyze the characteristics of each cluster to gain insights into the different customer segments. This may involve visualizing cluster centroids, examining feature distributions within clusters, and identifying distinguishing attributes that define each segment. I have visualized the clusters to understand the factors that are creating groups among the customers and find out common points that ultimately define the purchasing trend of the customers.
